<h2>How to understand Delta mining? </h2>
<div>

<h2>What is the difference between DTC and DTCT? </h2>

</div>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>What is a promotion ambassador? How is the team reward calculated? </h2>
<div>
<p>When you invite others to become members of Delta through your DID, you will automatically become a promotion ambassador. </p>
<p>Every time you directly recommend one person, your own mining rate will increase by 1/3 of the basic rate; every time you indirectly recommend (secondary recommendation) one person, the mining rate will increase by 1/10 of the basic rate. </p>
</div>
<h2>What is 3-No-Verification? </h2>
<div>
<p>It means that users do not need a private key, mnemonic, or password to enter the system. It is also called decentralized SMS verification. </p>

<p>Yes, Delta adopts 3-no verification + security circle, and users do not need to manage private keys, mnemonics and remember passwords. </p>
</div>

<h2>What is a security circle? </h2>
<div>
<p>The security circle is a verification model based on user social relationships, and this function is completely decentralized. Users add 3-5 trusted people in the social relationship circle to form a security circle, and help them achieve secondary security verification when necessary. The security circle function can effectively increase the difficulty of malicious attacks and reduce the risk of accounts being acquired by others. </p>
</div>
<h2>What is USDT dual-currency mining? </h2>
<div>
<p>USDT dual-currency mining means that DTC and USDT are mined at the same time, which is a means of traffic monetization. Link </p>

It can easily receive and send other public chain assets, and when users manage these assets, they do not need any private keys, mnemonics or passwords. This convenient and secure feature is mainly due to Delta's three-no verification protocol and Internet Computer-based ECDSA threshold signature (Threshold ECDSA signatures) technology.
