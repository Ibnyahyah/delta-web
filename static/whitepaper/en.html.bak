<h1 class="h1 text-center">Delta White Paper</h1>

<h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The birth of a decentralized encrypted digital currency called Bitcoin marks that human society is gradually moving
    towards the era of decentralized super-sovereign digital currency. It is the aspiration of the people of the world
    that a new digital currency that is fair, safe, value-preserving, fast, and green becomes a daily payment currency.
</p>
<p>
    Our mission is to build a digital currency and decentralized application platform that allows every ordinary person
    to freely participate in minting and operating.
</p>
<p>
    Our vision is to work with everyone in the world to create a super-sovereign digital currency that is fair, secure,
    fast, green, and inflation-free. We are committed to establishing a relatively free peer-to-peer ecosystem and
    online application environment, allowing everyone to participate freely and jointly promote the development and
    application of Delta.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h2">1.Brief introduction to the sovereign currency issue</h2>
<p>
    1.1 1.1The sovereign currency issuing country that acts as the world currency can obtain huge international
    seigniorage and international inflation tax benefits. This single world currency structure is an unfair structure.
</p>

<p>
    1.2
    The prerequisite for the function of international currency payment means is the strong credit guarantee of the
    currency issuing country. However, the <q id="tⅰ">Triffin Dilemma <a href="#fⅰ"><sup>ⅰ</sup></a></q> makes sovereign
    currency issuing countries face a dilemma.
    The single world currency pattern is an unstable structure.
</p>

<p>
    1.3
    The duality of currency value scales determines that only one currency can perform the functions of a world currency
    in the international market. The multi-polar world currency structure will lead to friction among currency-issuing
    countries and is detrimental to the peaceful development of the world economy.
</p>

<p>
    1.4
    centralized currency issuance power in order to stimulate the economy and increase fiscal revenue may lead to severe
    over-issuance of currency and high inflation. This will seriously affect the value of the existing currency in
    ordinary people's pockets and increase the economic pressure for survival .
</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.The current status and drawbacks of cryptocurrency</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote mb-2">
    Bitcoin is the earliest cryptocurrency. The concept was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto on November 1, 2008, and
    was officially born on January 3, 2009. The open source software designed and released based on Satoshi Nakamoto's
    ideas and the P2P network built on it. Bitcoin is a P2P form of digital currency. Bitcoin’s transaction records are
    open and transparent. Peer-to-peer transmission means a decentralized payment system. Unlike most currencies,
    Bitcoin is not issued by a specific monetary institution. It is generated through a large number of calculations
    based on a specific algorithm . Some encrypted digital currency products subsequently invented by humans also
    basically refer to the model and technology of Bitcoin.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Such models and technical solutions have many excellent benefits and have brought many inspirations to the
    subsequent development of digital currency. for example:
    Decentralization and immutability - these features ensure that the funds held by people are not controlled and
    supervised by any third party, while giving people a complete sense of ownership. Holders don’t have to worry about
    their funds being frozen or wiped, which is reassuring.
    Independence, fairness - Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any country, bank or financial institution, and they
    are based on a decentralized network. Theoretically, it avoids to a certain extent the competition and conflicts
    caused by countries pursuing advantages in monetary policies and financial systems.
</p>
<p>
    However, it also brings about many practical problems. Related issues will be discussed below.
</p>
<h3> 2.1 Security</h3>
<p>
    There are two main aspects of cryptocurrency security issues designed based on the above principles:
</p>
<ul class="list-decimal">
    <li>Private key cracking - The theoretical difficulty of cracking a Bitcoin private key is equal to cracking a
        256-bit key. In other words, the attacker needs to exhaust the problem approximately 10^ 77 times at most.
        Although this chance is very slim, no one can guarantee that a successful collision will definitely happen for
        the last time. At the same time, with the emergence and development of quantum computers, it will bring greater
        worries to holders.</li>
    <li>Private keys are lost or stolen - Keeping the private keys of cryptographic currencies is an important problem
        faced by holders. Regardless of whether you choose to use a cold wallet, paper wallet or brain wallet, there is
        a possibility that the private key will be lost or stolen, which makes people feel very anxious. Everyone in the
        world has had something lost or stolen, or forgotten important information. Therefore, no one can guarantee that
        this will not happen when it comes to managing private keys or mnemonic phrases. The worst part is that once
        lost or stolen, it cannot be retrieved or reset by any means, which brings huge risks to the holder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2.2 Fairness
</h3>
<p>
    an example, although its decentralized nature allows anyone to participate in verifying transactions and mining
    blocks, in the early days, only a few people devoted themselves to this and thus obtained a large amount of
    Bitcoins. With the rise of the Bitcoin network, a large amount of computing power has been concentrated in the hands
    of a few mining farms, resulting in large-scale centralization of Bitcoin production and wealth distribution.
    Currently, 87% of Bitcoins are owned by 1% of the network , making it difficult for most ordinary people to get
    involved. People who want to own Bitcoin in the later period can only buy it in the secondary market at high prices
    or invest huge sums of money to purchase computing power. This situation makes it difficult for most ordinary people
    to have the confidence and strength to join. Therefore, fairness is an issue worth thinking about in cryptocurrency
    networks such as Bitcoin .
</p>
<h3 id="energy_consumption_and_environmental_issues">2.3 Energy consumption and environmental issues</h3>
<p>
    According to real-time Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) data released by the <q id="tⅱ">Cambridge
        Center for Alternative Finance<a href="#fⅱ"><sup>ⅱ</sup></a></q>, the energy
    consumption of global Bitcoin mining is staggering. Currently, this figure is approximately 131.73TWh, which is
    comparable to the annual electricity consumption of countries such as Argentina or the Netherlands. In addition,
    Bitcoin mining also produces a large amount of carbon emissions, accounting for about 0.10% of total global
    emissions. This has exacerbated global environmental problems, especially climate change and environmental
    pollution.
</p>
<p>
    mining on Bitcoin and similar networks continues to expand, so does energy consumption and carbon emissions.
    However, although the energy consumption and carbon emissions of these mining have attracted much attention, it has
    also promoted the development and application of greener and more efficient encryption technologies.
</p>
<h3>2.4 POS dilemma</h3>
<p>
    The emergence of the POS (Proof of Stake) mechanism has indeed solved to a certain extent the problems of energy
    consumption and transaction speed of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. However, there are also some difficulties in
    the POS mechanism. The main problem is that in the POS mechanism, the validators with the most staked tokens can
    obtain verification qualifications and receive rewards faster. This mechanism may lead to "the rich getting richer
    and the poor getting poorer", thus raising the issue of distribution fairness. This further hinders the circulation
    and popularity of cryptocurrency.
</p>
<p>
    Under the POS mechanism, validators with a large number of tokens are able to obtain more rewards, which makes rich
    validators richer and poor validators poorer. This model may exacerbate the gap between the rich and the poor in
    society, reduce the participation of ordinary people, and thus hinder the popularity and development of
    cryptocurrency.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, there are some other problems with the POS mechanism. For example, staking tokens can create risks, and
    validators may suffer losses if the price of the token drops. In addition, the verifiers in the POS mechanism may be
    maliciously attacked by attackers, thus affecting the security and stability of the entire network.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, although the POS mechanism solves the problems of energy consumption and transaction speed of
    cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to a certain extent, it also brings some new problems and challenges. In order to
    solve these problems, further research and exploration of more fair, secure and effective consensus mechanisms are
    needed.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    <i>
        Of course, in addition to the security, fairness, energy consumption and POS issues mentioned above, there are
        other problems with various existing cryptocurrencies. For example, there are problems such as slow transaction
        speed, high transaction costs, large price fluctuations, lack of application scenarios, and exchange gaps. These
        problems will not be discussed here for the time being. The subsequent delta design description chapters will
        discuss how to solve and avoid these problems through some effective methods and strategies.

<h2>3.Delta is a more ideal digital currency system</h2>
<header class="italic">
    In order to design and develop a more ideal digital currency, we stand on the shoulders of our predecessors, learn
    from their advantages, and avoid making the same mistakes. At the same time, combined with the current social
    conditions and technological foundation, we take humanistic currency as the basic concept and are committed to
    designing and building an ideal digital currency system in the future society.
</header>
<h3>3.1 Terms and Definitions</h3>
<p>
In order to make it easier to explain and read this document, we write some necessary terms and definitions in the front
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disclosure-closed;">
<li>
<b>DTC:</b>This is the abbreviation of Delta Coin and the code of the digital currency
</li>
<li>
<b>DTCT:</b>This is the abbreviation of Delta Credit, which means DTC that has not been activated and released.
</li>
<li>
<b>δ:</b>This is the currency symbol of Delta Coin, such as 10δ, 100δ, 1000δ, etc.
</li>
<li>
<b>Mining:</b>In the Delta application, through specific allocation rules and patterns, users obtain DTCT by clicking operations.
</li>
</ul>

<header>Roles and Functions:</header>
<p>Roles and functions constitute an organic whole of currency minting, consensus building, and system security. In the Delta system, there are three core roles: miners, ambassadors, and validators.</p>

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>
<b>Miner:</b>Participants in the Delta system will obtain miner status when they conduct mining operations for the first time. Their main function is to perform mining operations on Delta's mobile app to generate DTC. This design is very interesting and practical because it has no additional electricity consumption and is environmentally friendly. It also does not cause time anxiety and affect personal health. In the process of building Delta consensus, miners are the main force.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ambassador:</b>
Any miner can recommend people around him to join Delta by using his own DID (digital identity) and build a micro-community network. Those who successfully recommend others to join will automatically obtain ambassador status. The ambassador's responsibility is to teach new members how to perform mining operations and help them understand the operating mechanism of Delta. Therefore, ambassadors are the key force in building Delta consensus.
</li>
<li>
<b>Validator:</b> The unique design of the Delta system makes it a digital currency system that does not require passwords, private keys, or mnemonics. In this system, the role of the validator is to provide account identity authentication services for unspecified users through verification terminals. Any miner has the opportunity to become a validator through the election process, and they play an important role in ensuring the security of the system.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mobile_phone_mining">3.2 Mobile phone mining</h3>
<p>
Introducing the concept of mining in cryptocurrency helps solve the problem of fair distribution in currency issuance. <q id="tⅲ">Pi Network<a href="#fⅲ"><sup>ⅲ</sup></a></q>
Pioneered the innovative design of mobile mining, which is green and environmentally friendly, effectively avoids energy consumption problems, and does not require the computing power of the device and additional networks. With the high popularity of mobile phones today, it has become possible for ordinary people to participate in digital currency mining. Delta inherited this design. It should be noted that the essence of mining lies in distribution, not calculation. In the design of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto used the computing power of participants to calculate mathematical problems to compete for the right to record and reward Bitcoin. It can be seen that computing power is only used to compete for the game of accounting rights, and it has no direct connection with accounting. From the working principle of the computer, it is just a process of writing data to the disk, and this process consumes very little energy. Therefore, abandoning computing power mining is completely reasonable and feasible under the background of existing technology.
</p>
<h3>3.3 Proof of People (POP)</h3>
<p>
If we call the proof of contribution to the network by the amount of computer computing power POW mining (Proof of Work), and the proof of contribution to the network by the amount of pledged currency POS mining (Proof of
Stake), then we can call the proof of contribution to the network by the authenticity of the person himself POP mining (Proof of People). When we enable the Delta program on the mobile phone to mine, it is not the mobile phone itself that is conducting the mining process, but the mobile phone is used as a carrier to verify the authenticity of the individual. Therefore, the essence of Delta is to give the right to mint coins to the people, which is a concept of people-oriented currency.
</p>
<h3 id="3-no-verification">3.4 3-No-Verification</h3>
<header>
The creative design makes Delta a cryptocurrency system that does not require a password or a private key.
</header>
<p>
3-No-Verification is the only way for users to enter the Delta system. In order to solve the cryptocurrency security issues mentioned in Section 2.1, we proposed and used 3-No-Verification in the design of Delta account identity authentication.
Meaning:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>No password</li>
<li>No private key</li>
<li>No mnemonic</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why we do not need a password, private key, or mnemonic is that if the system is still designed in the form of account + password, it will need to be password protected by email or SMS, which will lead to serious doubts about the degree of decentralization and the continuity of services. Specifically, email authentication requires a dedicated outbox address, and SMS verification requires an SMS access number or sending port applied for by a telecommunications company. These resources not only need to be maintained continuously, but also need to be paid for. These tasks need to be performed by centralized human operations, which will cause users to feel distrust and contradict the core concept of decentralized applications.
</p>
<p>
After the birth of Bitcoin, asymmetric private keys were used as a means of authority authentication, which is a completely decentralized authentication scheme. Later, in order to facilitate user memory and management, developers derived mnemonic solutions and widely used them in decentralized applications. However, these solutions all have risks such as loss, forgetting, and theft of private keys or mnemonics, and make users feel anxious. Therefore, we need a safer and more convenient authentication method to replace traditional passwords, private keys, and mnemonics.
</p>
<p>
Since passwords, private keys, and mnemonics are at risk of being cracked, lost, and forgotten, it is not impossible to abandon these three verification methods to achieve decentralized account verification. Delta has successfully achieved three-no verification, which is mainly due to the powerful functions of the Internet Computer based on blockchain and the highly mature mobile communication network around the world. MSISDN is the only number that can identify mobile users in the mobile communication network, so the three-no verification is also called decentralized SMS authentication. Delta developers have designed a "decentralized SMS authentication protocol" framework, which is a completely reliable and decentralized solution. The technical background and more detailed description of Internet Computer will be introduced in the subsequent technical solution chapter. </p>

<p>
    <b>3.3.1
    Verification process and rules,</b> The verification process and rules are summarized as follows: First, we allow users who meet certain conditions to apply for verification terminal permissions to become verifiers. Verifiers can use idle MSISDN (i.e. mobile phone number) and smartphones to download and install the Delta verification application. Use MSISDN as the access number to receive and forward verification strings. Verifiers only need to ensure that the mobile phone power and network connection are stable, and the verification process will be completely completed automatically by the Delta system. When a large number of users apply and become verifiers, a verification terminal pool will be formed. After that, when a user performs operations that require identity authentication such as registration, login or transfer, the Delta system will generate a verification string. The user will select a well-functioning terminal from the verification terminal pool and send the verification string to the access number of the terminal in the form of a text message. After receiving the verification string, the verification terminal will also extract the sender number and forward it to the Delta system. Finally, the Delta system performs verification comparison, and the legitimate user's request will be allowed to pass. For more detailed information, please refer to the <q id="tⅳ">Decentralized SMS Verification Protocol<a href="#fⅳ"><sup>ⅳ</sup></a></q> framework.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, it is necessary to explain that: First, in the early stage when the system has not yet formed enough verification terminals, developers will access a global virtual access number to provide verification access for early users. Once the number of verifiers can meet the basic needs, this virtual access number will be removed. Second, in order to avoid users incurring high international SMS charges, the system will give priority to displaying the verification access number of their own country for users who need verification.
</p>
    <header>Figure 1 (Verification Principle Diagram)</header>
<img src="/img/whitepaper1.png">
<p>
    <b>3.3.2 Validator rules,</b> our design includes the following items:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>Number rule: The upper limit of the number of validators in each region (divided by E.164 country code) is 1/10,000 of the total registered population, and the minimum number of validators is 1,000.
    </li>
    <li>Pledge campaign: To become a validator, you must pass the pledge campaign. Candidates need to put a certain number of Delta
    Coins into the campaign pool and download the Delta verification terminal to ensure normal connection with the Delta system. According to the campaign rules, the system will automatically select a certain number of winners from the campaign pool to become validators within each campaign cycle (one day). A maximum of 30 people will be selected in each cycle, and the total number of people selected cannot exceed the upper limit specified by the region. The successful validator will be awarded a 90-day work cycle.
    </li>
    <li>Offline penalty: During the work cycle (90 days), the validator shall not be offline for more than 1 hour for any reason, otherwise its pledged funds will be confiscated and transferred back to the community mining fund pool. </li>
    <li>Attack penalty: For validators who attempt to obtain the rights of others through attack behaviors (such as packet capture, tampering, etc.), the system will confiscate their pledged funds and mark them as dishonest users. </li>
    <li>Election renewal: After the 90-day work period expires, the validator can choose to continue to participate in the pledge election to maintain the verification service. The pledge amount can be calculated in addition to the amount during the current service period. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, a reward mechanism is provided for honest verifiers, and the detailed measures for the reward will be explained in the economic model section.
        </p>
        <h3 id="safety_circle">3.5 Safety Circle</h3>
        <p>
        After the introduction of the 3-No
        Authentication (three-no verification) security verification model, the use and management of digital assets will become safer and more convenient. However, in special circumstances, this single verification mechanism may lose its security. For example, when a mobile device is lost or stolen by others, the other party may have full control of the device, including sending verification SMS. In order to prevent this from happening and protect the security of account assets, we have added a safety circle function to the system design to provide secondary identity authentication for accounts to enhance account security.
        </p>
        <p>
        The safety circle is a verification model based on user social relationships, and the function is completely decentralized. It helps users achieve security verification through their social relationship circles. The safety circle function can effectively increase the difficulty of malicious attacks and reduce the risk of accounts being acquired by others.
        </p>
        <p>
        The working principle of the security circle is as follows: First, users can add trusted people (usually relatives and friends) to their security circle member list, usually 3-5 people. When the account needs to be verified by the security circle, the Delta smart contract program will randomly select a member from the security circle member list to assist the current user in confirming his identity by providing a security code. When the current user asks the member for a security code, the selected security circle member will be able to help confirm whether the user is himself. At the same time, the program will prompt: "Refuse to provide a security code if it is not a relative or friend" to protect the security of the account. Therefore, any Delta user should ensure that the people in the security circle member list are trustworthy.
    </p>

<header>When do you need to use the security circle? </header>
<ul class="list-decimal">
<li>When a user loses a mobile phone with the Delta program installed, the user should use a new device to forcefully log in to the Delta app. In this case, the user needs to use the security circle verification to ensure the security of his account. Since the phone is lost, the original verification status has expired, and the user needs to verify his identity and log in to the app with the help of the security circle members.
</li>
<li>When the account performs sensitive operations, such as changing the mobile phone number or updating the security circle members, in order to prevent these operations from being performed by others, it is also necessary to enable the security circle verification. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="economic_model">3.6 Economic Model</h3>
<p>
In Section 2.2, we mentioned the fairness issues in the distribution of existing cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the design of Delta's distribution rules needs to avoid the distribution method similar to Bitcoin, that is, to distribute most of the coins to early participants. This distribution method may cause later participants to purchase at high prices, making it a speculative tool. This not only hinders the formation of human currency consensus, but also may make the circulation value impossible to achieve. Therefore, Delta's distribution rules need to be implemented in a more reasonable way.
</p>
<p>
First, we define the initial total amount of Delta
Coin as 300 billion. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Delta uses such a large total amount to facilitate circulation and use in daily life. (For example, we hope to price a box of 250 ml of milk at 0.3δ, and we don't want 0.0000003δ. Too many zeros after the decimal point will confuse people)
</p>
<header>Then, we divide these 300 billion into four parts, each of which plays a different role:</header>
<ul style="list-style-type:disclosure-closed">
<li>Part 1: Community Mining - 60%</li>
<li>Part 2: Consensus Expansion Fund (for Ambassador Recommendation, New Registration and Validator Rewards) - 10%</li>
<li>Part 3: Ecosystem Construction Reward Fund - 20%</li>
<li>Part 4: ICP Fuel Crowdfunding - 10%</li>
</ul>
<header>Chart 2 (Allocation Ratio)</header>
<img src="/img/whitepaper2.png">
<aside>The purpose of distributing the currency in multiple parts is to promote the development of community consensus and ecological construction simultaneously, and aims to stimulate the enthusiasm of the community's initial ecological construction and ensure the reliability of long-term system operation. </aside>

<header>Some additional notes on the distribution plan are as follows:</header>
<ul class="list-decimal">
    <li>The initial total amount and the current distribution plan are implemented under the "temporary governance mode". Obviously, these total amounts are not enough to be used as a global consensus currency. Later, the "Governance Committee" elected by all Delta members in the DAO model can discuss and propose additional issuance proposals based on development needs. </li>
    <li>The initial 300 billion coins do not mean that all of them can become circulated DTC in the future. These 300 billion are the total amount of Delta Credit (DTCT), which means the effective amount before it is activated and released through KYC. After KYC screening, the final circulated DTC amount is generally less than DTCT. </li>
    <li>Delta is based on the concept of human-centered currency. In theory, all coins should be distributed through community mining and consensus expansion, while the rest should be raised through donations or handling fees. However, in the early stages of the project, the demand and workload of ecological construction were very large. In order to ensure the success of the project and give more confidence to ecological builders, we implemented reserved allocation. Similarly, the fuel crowdfunding part is also to provide a more reliable operating mechanism.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>3.6.1 Community Mining</h4>
<p>
The total amount of community mining is 180 billion coins, which is equal to 60% of the total amount of 300 billion coins. We distribute these coins by real users signing in every day to contribute their attention. This method can form a consensus after a long time. The principle is that users convert intangible virtual numbers into currency consensus by contributing their attention, and this consensus in turn promotes its value as currency. In terms of the basic mining rate, in order to find a balance between early incentives and long-term fairness, we adopted a two-stage doubling scheme design.
</p>
<p>
Phase 1: When the number of participants is between 1 and 30 million, the rate between 1 and 3,000 is 32δ/day, which is used as the starting benchmark. Every time the number of people increases by 10 times, the rate is halved until the number of participants reaches 30 million and the rate drops to 2δ/day before entering the next stage.
</p>
<p>
Phase 2: When the number of participants reaches 30 million or more, the basic rate will be halved every time the number of participants increases by 3 times until the mining is completed and production is stopped.
</p>
<figure>
    <aside>Chart 3 (Chart analysis of basic rate halving)</aside>
    <img src="/img/whitepaper3.png" alt="Chart analysis of basic rate halving" />
</figure>
<h4>3.6.2 Registration and Referral Rewards</h4>
<p>In order to promote the faster development of the Delta network, we have set up a referral reward program. After becoming a miner, anyone can become a promotion ambassador and get these rewards by recommending others. </p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Fixed referral rewards: In order to invite friends and relatives to join Delta, the referrer only needs to share his digital DID through a QR code or link. When the other party fills in the referrer's digital DID when registering, both parties will receive a reward of 1δ. If the referral registration occurs after the community mining stops, the reward will be halved, and each will receive 0.5δ. This part of the reward will be distributed from the total amount of 30 billion "Consensus Expansion Fund".
</li>
<li>Direct referral reward: For each person directly recommended by the ambassador, when the referee is in the mining state, his mining rate will increase by 1/3 of the basic rate. In addition, when the ambassador's superior referrer is in the mining state, it will also be calculated into the direct referral reward according to this ratio. </li>
<p>Assuming the current base rate is 16δ/day, the number of people recommended by the ambassador is n, and they are in the mining state, then the calculation formula for this part of the increased income for the day is as follows: $i 16 \times \frac{1}{3} \times (n+1) = x (δ/day) $i</p>
<li>Indirect referral reward: The ambassador directly recommends everyone in the team, and everyone they recommend represents the ambassador's indirect referral user. When an indirect referral user is in the mining state, the mining rate of the recommending ambassador will be increased by an additional 1/10 of the base rate. </li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming the base rate is the same as above, the number of people indirectly recommended and in the mining state is n<sub>2</sub>, then the calculation formula for this part of the increased income for the day is as follows: $i 16 \times \frac{1}{10} \times n_2 = x (δ/day)
$i. The two parts of direct referral and indirect referral rewards will be calculated in combination and allocated from the total community mining funds of 180 billion. </p>

<h4>3.6.3 Validator Rewards</h4>
<p>In Chapter 3.4, the basic principles and processes of three-no verification are explained. In order to implement such a verification procedure, the system requires some users to apply to become validators, and we also need to design certain rewards to motivate those who pay for it. The reward method and amount of the validator are divided into two cases. </p>
<p>
① First, when 10% of the consensus expansion fund has not been used up, the validator's reward will be paid using this part of the fund. The specific amount of the reward for each completed verification is 1/3 of the current mining base rate.
</p>
<p>
② In addition, when the consensus expansion fund has been exhausted, the verification fee will be paid by the user who needs verification, and this fee will be automatically deducted after the verification process is completed. At this time, the verification fee will be calculated at 3 times the daily transfer fee.
</p>
<h4>
    3.6.4 Ecosystem Construction Reward Fund
    </h4>
    <p>
    In order to promote the construction and development of Delta's ecology in various aspects, the fund will be oriented to multiple ecological construction reward programs, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-decimal">
    <li>Ecosystem dApp Developer Reward Program: Aims to encourage early ecological development, contributions to Delta's ecology, and high-quality ecological project developers. For more details, please refer to the dApp Square section. </li>
    <li>Image and Popularity Promotion Reward Program: Aims to reward individuals or teams who have made special contributions to Delta's image and popularity promotion. </li>
    <li>Early Transaction Reward Program: Used to reward users who participate in various early transactions in the Delta application. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the early "temporary governance mode", the fund is managed and planned by the Delta core team. Its goal is to promote the prosperity and development of all aspects of Delta's ecological construction. The specific uses and rules will be designed and adjusted according to actual needs and clearly stated in the relevant use plan.
    </p>
    <p>
    Afterwards, once the "DAO governance mode" is entered, the core team will transfer the remaining funds to the DAO for custody. Subsequent usage decisions will be made by the DAO.
</p>
<h4>3.6.5 ICP fuel crowdfunding</h4>
<p>
The fund allocation method in this regard will be explained in the fuel mechanism chapter
</p>
<h4>3.6.6 Handling fees</h4>
<p>
One of the benefits of generating a certain handling fee during transactions is to prevent malicious small transfers from generating a large amount of garbage accounting data attacks to protect the healthy operation of the Delta system. In addition, the handling fee of the Delta system will adopt a burning mode, and the handling fee consumed by the transaction will be directly transferred to an empty address.
</p>
<p>
Under the "temporary governance mode", the handling fee burned for each transaction is 1‰, and the minimum limit is 0.01δ and the maximum limit is 0.3δ. Under this mode, in order to ensure that power is not abused, new coins shall not be issued for any reason, which is equivalent to a deflation mechanism under this mode.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, under the "DAO governance model", DAO can implement the additional issuance mechanism through proposals according to actual needs. The additional currency can make up for the burning part of the handling fee and prevent further deflation. The first part of the additional currency will be used to pay for the fuel "cycles" for Delta operation. The rest can be used to govern participation reward funds and other matters that are conducive to the healthy development of the ecosystem. In addition, under the long-term DAO governance model, the specific amount or rules of transaction procedures can be re-determined through annual proposals.
</p>
<h3>3.7 KYC Verification</h3>
<p>KYC (Know Your
Customer/Client) verification is an important process that aims to confirm the identity of users and prevent the creation of fake accounts. In the Delta system, KYC verification is particularly important because its mining mechanism is based on social networks and is completely decentralized. In order to ensure fair distribution and eliminate false identity mining, we plan to use a combination of AI recognition and community KYC market. Users can use the KYC market to achieve anonymous cross-authentication of community members and establish a certain reward and punishment mechanism. These measures will ensure the fairness of the Delta system and the healthy development of the ecosystem, while increasing users' trust and participation in the system.
</p>
<p>
First, AI recognition technology can be used in the identity verification process to automatically identify and compare the identity documents provided by users through deep learning and image recognition technology. This can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of identity verification and reduce human errors and fraud.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the community KYC market is a market mechanism based on the idea of ​​decentralization. Through manual inspection and judgment, it can prevent behaviors such as "human skin masks" and "digital face-changing", and effectively prevent fraud and attacks against AI. Users can use this market to realize anonymous cross-certification and confirmation of community members. In the community KYC market, users can publish their own identity information, and set up a certain reward and punishment mechanism to encourage other users to verify and cross-certify. In this way, we can establish a mechanism of mutual supervision and trust to ensure the authenticity and credibility of each account.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, in the process of manual inspection and certification in the KYC market, we adopt the method of selective disclosure. In certification, selective disclosure refers to the process of verifying the authenticity of individuals by only showing the necessary information required for verification to the verifier while ensuring that personal information is not leaked.
The advantage of this method is that it can effectively verify the necessary information while ensuring that the privacy of the verifier is not leaked. Delta uses fragmented distributed storage when processing personal information, which provides a technical basis for selective disclosure of identity authentication.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, in order to prevent malicious behavior and the creation of fake accounts, the Delta system will also establish a strict regulatory mechanism. If suspicious behavior or illegal operations are found, the system will immediately take corresponding measures, such as suspending or marking the relevant accounts to prevent the process from continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Through the above measures, the Delta system can effectively prevent the creation of fake accounts and malicious behavior, and ensure the fairness and reliability of the system. At the same time, KYC verification can also increase users' trust and participation in the Delta system and promote the healthy development of the Delta ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
    After that, when the user obtains KYC certification, the system will immediately release the first DTC for the user. For specific release rules, please refer to the 3.12 Release Mechanism section.
    </p>
<h3>3.8 Non-KYC Accounts</h3>
<p>
    In the Delta system, no one has the authority to delete or freeze any account. This is because when the Delta program was written in the early days, such functions or interfaces were not designed, which is more in line with the concept of decentralization and user autonomy. Therefore, non-KYC accounts are allowed to exist in the system for a long time and can participate in transactions or interactions. However, accounts that have passed KYC certification will receive specific marks, and accounts that are not marked with KYC will be restricted from certain rights, such as participating in DTCT fund release operations, becoming transaction sellers, etc. Since unmarked KYC may be regarded as untrustworthy, it may be rejected by some system ecological sub-applications or counterparties.
</p>
<h3>3.9 Fuel Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
    First of all, the operation of all computer programs requires electricity and hardware costs. For example, for traditional Web2 programs, it is necessary to host services on platforms such as Amazon
    AWS and pay resource usage fees. Blockchain is no exception. Bitcoin miners need to purchase expensive ASIC mining machines and pay high electricity bills. Their operating costs are fed back to miners in the form of mining rewards and transfer fees. Therefore, the transfer fees of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are quite expensive. Other POS-based blockchains reduce the cost of mining (game-like computing power calculations), so the transfer fees are relatively reduced, but the governance cost of this model is still very high, and the final fee is still high.
</p>
<p>
    Delta also requires operating costs. Delta runs entirely in the encrypted space (Cypherspace) of the Internet Computer developed by Dfinity. The architectural design of the Internet Computer is more advanced than traditional blockchains and has lower operating costs. According to official data, storage costs are about $5/GB/year, and the Internet Computer is not billed in sovereign currency. Instead, it requires a fuel called <q
    id="tⅵ">cycles to support computing operations and storage <a href="#fⅵ"><sup>ⅵ</sup></a></q>
    . This "cycle" is generated by the conversion of Internet
    Computer (ICP) utility tokens. Therefore, Delta needs ICP as a utility token as operating costs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Therefore, Delta needs a fuel mechanism to ensure the long-term operation of its program. According to the development of Delta, we divide the fuel source into 3 stages, namely the startup stage, the consensus building stage, and the consensus formation stage.
    </p>
    <p>
    ①　Startup phase - in the early stage when Delta is deployed to no users, the core developers will inject 30 ICP tokens into the Internet Computer smart tank at one time (the smart tank will be explained in detail in the operating environment section) to ensure the normal operation of the program and provide service guarantees for users who are about to join.
    </p>
    <p>
    ②　Consensus building phase - refers to the stage from the start of operation to the stage before the circulation value is generated. In this stage, we launch an "ICP fuel crowdfunding" subroutine in Delta's application square to raise the "cycles" fuel required for Delta to operate. Any user can use this subroutine to raise the ICP tokens required to convert "cycles" fuel for Delta. The program will reward participants with the corresponding number of Delta Credits as a bonus for their support according to the set algorithm. These rewardable ICP tokens are the fourth part of the total distribution (ICP fuel crowdfunding), totaling 30 billion δ, and crowdfunding will automatically stop after all are distributed. All ICP tokens raised through crowdfunding will be stored in a virtual DID that is not bound to MSISDN (meaning that no one has the authority to operate this virtual DID). The Delta Fuel Management Program will automatically monitor the "cycles" balance in the smart tank. When "cycles" is less than 3000
    billion, 10 of the ICP in the virtual account will be automatically exchanged for "cycles". The calculation result of the crowdfunding exchange rate is mainly determined by the two parameters of the total number of users and the amount issued. The specific algorithm formula is as follows:
    </p>
<ul style="margin-left:4rem">
    <li class="-ml-2">Definition:</li>
    <li>$i R = Registration amount $i</li>
    <li>$i D = Issued Delta Credit amount $i</li>
    <li>$i Ex\_rate = Current crowdfunding exchange rate $i</li>
    <li>$i Ex\_rate = \frac{log(D)}{3} \times log(R) \times 0.0001 $i</li>
    <li>Where 3 and 0.0001 are fixed constants</li>
    <li>Assume that the current registration amount R=100000, and the crowdfunding reward amount D=330000,</li>
    <li>Then, the current exchange rate is calculated as follows:</li>
    <li>$i Ex\_rate = \frac{log(330000)}{3} \times log(100000) \times 0.0001 $i</li>
    <li>$i Ex\_rate ≈ 0.004876 $i</li>
    <li>Currently: 1 ICP can be exchanged for $i 1 \div 0.004876 = 205$iδ (the result is rounded to an approximate integer)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    ③　共识形成阶段——是指完成大规模KYC验证并进入“DAO治理模式”后， DAO可以根据增发提案，增发一定量的Delta Coin弥补交易手续费燃烧，并将增发额度的一部分优先用于兑换燃料”cycles”。
</p>

<h3>3.10 dApp Plaza</h3>
<p>
dApp Plaza is Delta's decentralized application market, a platform for Delta's online ecosystem construction, and a future-oriented Web3 application center. Any user with development capabilities can develop Delta applications and settle in. After extensive community discussion and voting, the "Delta Application Ecosystem White Paper" will be drafted and released. The white paper will determine the design and specifications of developer reward policies, ethical behavior, user privacy, and user data autonomy strategies.
</p>

<h3>
    3.11 USDT Dual Currency Mining
    </h3>
    <p>
    <q id="tⅶ">USDT<a href="#fⅶ"><sup>ⅶ</sup></a></q> Dual currency mining means mining two digital currencies, DTC and USDT, at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Its purpose is to provide miners with a certain amount of effective income in the early stage when the Delta ecosystem has not yet formed and prospered; at the same time, it also provides developers with a certain amount of financial support to ensure that developers can continue to provide development services for a long time and ultimately realize Delta's planning and vision; it also provides advertisers with an effective promotion channel to promote the positive development of consensus.
    </p>
    <p>
    Its principle is to use the huge user group of the Delta community to realize traffic monetization, providing multiple benefits for advertisers, Delta core developers and miners.
    </p>
    <p>
    The method is to connect to the existing mature advertising platform. Users can display incentive ads and obtain monetization income through a "play button" in the USCT mining module.
    </p>
    <p>
    For details on the distribution mechanism and settlement cycle, please refer to the Delta App "USCT Mining Module" page.
</p>

<h3>3.12 Activation and Release Mechanism</h3>
<p>
After the emergence of Ethereum smart contracts, the market has issued a variety of tokens. Most of these tokens have a release activation mechanism. Their method is generally to require users to promise (or stipulate) to pledge tokens at a certain ratio and for a certain period of time, and then release them once or multiple times according to the pledge period. The released tokens can obtain the right to flow freely.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this design is to ensure the stability and upward trend of token prices and prevent the collapse of token value due to large-scale selling. The principle is to achieve the development of ecology and consensus through the extension of time. This is indeed helpful for early consensus construction and price stability, but its effect is not strong. Because this will form a large number of zombie users in the system. These zombie users do nothing but wait for the arrival of time and the surge in prices. This situation is of no help to the long-term construction of the consensus ecology.
</p>
<p>
To this end, Delta redefined the release mechanism. We combined the cycle with community behavior, that is, within a set cycle and meeting certain behavioral conditions, DTC will be released. We call this release mechanism behavioral cycle release.
</p>
<p>
Our specific design is as follows: Set the release of account DTC to 100 cycles, each cycle is at least 7 days, and each cycle is released in equal amounts, and a total of 100 cycles are released. After the account completes the corresponding barter behavior within a cycle, it can obtain the release right.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, first, before large-scale KYC, we will establish a "flea market" application in the dApp Square. This application allows any Delta user to publish and buy and sell idle goods on it. The transaction behavior on this application will be organically combined with the DTC release program. When a user generates a purchase or sale behavior on the "flea market" application, the behavior will be automatically transmitted to the DTC release program. The buying and selling behavior that complies with the rules will immediately trigger the release mechanism and complete the DTC release that should be made within the cycle.
</p>
<p>
The first DTC release will be executed immediately after the user completes KYC, and 1/100 of the total amount will be released. After that, every 7 days, if the user has a valid transaction on the "Flea Market" application, the DTC release will be triggered. The release amount of each cycle is 1/99, 1/98, and 1/97 of the total amount, until the last 1/1 is released.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the condition that effective behavior needs to meet is that one-way buying or selling cannot be carried out for a long time. In the program design, there are up to 3 consecutive one-way behaviors. After exceeding, the current amount will not be released until the transaction direction is changed.
</p>
<p>
In terms of periodicity, in the actual program design, we judge it as a valid release action for up to 2 times within 14 consecutive days. This helps users to arrange trading time flexibly. In addition to the releasable trading behaviors, users can participate in more trading behaviors, which is completely free and helps to build better consensus.
</p>
<h3>3.13 DID digital identity</h3>
<p>
When a user enters the Delta application through the three-no verification, the system will generate a globally unique 13-digit string for it as a digital identity DID (decentralized identifier). As a digital identity DID, it not only carries personal information and credit value, but also can manage, receive and send assets. Combined with the implementation of KYC, a unique, authentic and trustworthy binding relationship is formed between the user and the DID digital identity.
</p>
<p>
In the future, it will be possible for users to authorize and manage other third-party applications or digital twins in the metaverse through the Delta digital identity DID.
</p>
<h3>3.14 Privacy Protection and Traceability</h3>
<p>
If an individual's financial status is fully disclosed in the transaction ledger, it may cause anxiety, uneasiness, embarrassment or shame. Whether the property is large or small, exposing the property status may have adverse effects on the individual. Therefore, the right to protect personal privacy cannot be ignored.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, traceability plays a positive role in improving data security and trust. The transparency and traceability of transaction data increase people's trust and sense of security in assets, so that people do not have to worry about data tampering or black-box operations.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, privacy protection and traceability are equally important. We need a reasonable method to solve these two seemingly conflicting problems. Delta adopts the separation design of accounting address and DID digital identity, and the one-way association of DID digital identity and accounting address to solve this problem. The accounting address uses an 18- to 19-digit cryptographic address based on Base58 encoding, which is a variant of the Bitcoin address algorithm. Its purpose is to make it easier for people to distinguish it from the Bitcoin address and save storage resources. In this way, all funds and transactions are recorded on the accounting address. Anyone can view and track transactions through the Delta browser, but the DID digital identity corresponding to the accounting address cannot be found. Multiple accounting addresses can be created under one DID digital identity (to prevent abuse, when more than one address is created under one DID digital identity, a transaction fee will be incurred for each address created), and a default payment address can be set. Users can use any address to receive payments, and can also directly use DID digital identity or mobile phone number to receive payments. The amount received using DID or mobile phone number will be automatically transferred to the default address. In this way, users can choose between privacy and convenience according to the usage scenario.
</p>
<h3>3.15 Decentralized Multi-Chain Wallet</h3>
<p>
Decentralized Multi-Chain Wallet is one of the core features built into the Delta system. Delta Multi-Chain Wallet enables users to transfer assets, exchange information and collaborate with other blockchains. It can easily receive and send other public chain assets, and when users manage these assets, they do not need any private keys, mnemonics or passwords at all. This convenient and secure feature is mainly due to Delta's three-no verification protocol and Internet Computer-based ECDSA threshold signature (Threshold ECDSA
signatures) technology. ECDSA threshold signature technology allows people to create addresses of third-party blockchains and perform transfers without holding private keys. This makes the assets hosted in the Delta Multi-Chain Wallet very safe and trustworthy.
</p>
<q class="blockquote mb-2">
Internet Computer implements a novel threshold ECDSA protocol as part of its chain key signature toolbox. In this protocol, private ECDSA keys exist only as fragments of secret shares held by designated parties, i.e., replicas of a subnet on the IC that supports threshold ECDSA, and signatures are computed using these secret shares without reconstructing the private key. Each replica of such a subnet possesses a fragment of the key share that itself provides no information (in fact, any set of shared fragments that reaches a threshold of one-third is indistinguishable from a set of random strings). At least one-third of the replicas are required to use their respective key fragments to generate a threshold signature. In addition to the actual threshold signature protocol, chain-key ECDSA includes secure key distributed key generation and a periodic key re-sharing protocol, which are key parts of the protocol. This makes chain-key ECDSA signatures stronger than any off-the-shelf threshold ECDSA protocol.
</q>
<br />
<q class="blockquote mb-2" id="tⅷ">
Every container on any subnet of the Internet Computer can control a unique ECDSA public key and can request the computation of a signature for this public key. Signatures are issued only to eligible containers, i.e., the legal holders of the ECDSA key. Each container can only obtain signatures of its own ECDSA
key. Note that the container itself does not hold any ECDSA private keys or key sharing fragments. Threshold cryptography can help implement features in the blockchain trust model that are not possible using traditional cryptography alone<a href="#fⅷ"><sup>ⅷ</sup></a>.
</q>

<h3>3.16 Technical Solution and Implementation</h3>
<p>
Delta chose Internet Computer (IC) as the basic operating environment and used the Motoko programming language to implement its server-side coding. The comprehensive and complex functions of the Delta system are made possible by the powerful programmability and high-speed, low-cost operating environment provided by IC.
</p>
<p>
Internet Computer (IC) is currently the most advanced smart contract container operating platform in the world. This achievement is attributed to Dominic
Williams, founder and chief scientist of the DFINITY Foundation. It is the result of years of research led by him and a large number of top computer and cryptography experts, providing a strong and reliable foundation for the implementation of Delta.
</p>
<p>
Internet
Computer (hereinafter referred to as IC) realizes the vision of the world computer - an open and secure blockchain-based network that can host programs and data in the form of smart contracts, perform calculations on smart contracts in a secure and reliable manner, and expand infinitely. IC smart contracts are composable and autonomous software components running on a decentralized blockchain, which makes them impossible to be tampered with and stopped. IC frees smart contracts from the speed, storage cost, and computing power limitations of traditional blockchains, unleashing the full potential of smart contracts. IC allows smart contracts to be fully decentralized for the first time.
</p>
<p>
About the Motoko programming language, it is a new, modern, type-safe language for building smart contracts for the next generation of distributed applications to run on the Internet Computer blockchain network. Motoko is specifically designed to support the unique features of Internet Computer and provide a powerful programming environment and capabilities that users are familiar with.

<h3>3.17 Logo and Currency Symbol</h3>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Symbol: δ, such as 10δ, 100δ, 1000δ. </li>

<li>Festival: In order to enrich spiritual life and promote the communication and development of Delta, we need to define a festival. Starting from 2023, March 3rd of each year will be defined as Delta's festival. At the same time, all Delta transactions generated on that day will be completely free of fees. This mechanism of free transaction fees will be set in the program at the beginning of development.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Future</h2>
<h3>4.1 Stablecoin</h3>
<p>
Undoubtedly, sovereign currency is the most popular currency at present. We expect Delta to become the mainstream super-sovereign digital currency in the world in the future. <q id="tⅸ" title="Stablecoin">Stablecoin<a href="#fⅸ"><sup>ⅸ</sup></a></q>
It is a cryptographic digital currency that always keeps consistent with the price of sovereign currency. This means that, from the perspective of value, it can be directly replaced in the current legal currency transaction scenario. Reliable stablecoin is a bridge between non-sovereign currency and sovereign currency. We plan to design a universal stablecoin that allows every ordinary citizen to participate in the casting and operation, which will completely trigger the prevalence of non-sovereign digital currency in the future. We will strive to establish such a stablecoin based on Delta in the subsequent community discussion and opinion collection process.
</p>
<h3>4.2 Open Source Method</h3>
<p>
In order to ensure the transparency, fairness and openness of the system, and to gain the support of a wider community and become a common currency system for all mankind, Delta's open source will be imperative. The entire Delta system needs to consist of multiple parts and multiple software projects, which need to run in different environments, such as running on the Internet as a server, running on Android or IOS devices as a client, or in the form of a web. In order to protect the Delta ecosystem and prevent the abuse of source code, we will gradually open source some software projects according to development needs. It is expected that when the total number of users reaches 1/30 of the world's total population, we will be completely open source.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Governance and Upgrades</h3>
<p>
In order to establish a lasting governance model and find a balance between efficiency and fairness, Delta will adopt a two-stage plan.
</p>
<h4>4.3.1 Temporary governance model</h4>
<p>
Before the system is open source, a "temporary governance model" will be adopted, similar to the current mainstream "off-chain" governance model. In this model, core developers play a very important role in the development and development direction of the system. Delta will first enable a "roadmap" subroutine, and developers will first publish the completed parts, ongoing parts, and planned parts in the "roadmap". In addition, the "roadmap" subroutine will also have the functions of suggestion and voting, and any member of the Delta community can use this function to give feedback and make suggestions. Finally, the core developers will further update the roadmap based on these opinions and suggestions. This model can ensure efficiency and openness, but it is very dependent on core developers in terms of fairness and durability.
</p>
<h4>4.3.2 DAO model</h4>
<p>
After the system is fully open source, the "decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model" will be adopted. In the DAO model, Delta will establish a "governance committee" and a "developer committee" based on the voting of all users, and rely on a service nervous system (SNS). Governance committee members will publish and vote on proposals through this SNS system, and the proposals that are finally voted through will be taken over by the "Developer Committee" members and implemented. After the implementation is completed, it will be submitted to the "Developer Committee" for review and voting. After the vote is passed, the new version of the program will be released by SNS. The execution flow of this process will be controlled by SNS. In addition, a "Governance and Developer Reward Fund" will be established to reward the governors and developers who have invested time and energy in Delta. The cost of the "Governance and Developer Reward Fund" mainly comes from part of the newly issued quota after the transaction fee is burned and the remaining part of the original "Eco-Construction Reward Fund".
</p>
<p>
In terms of form, in order to increase people's attention to each upgrade and express the importance of each upgrade, Delta will adopt a naming method related to global rivers to name each major version upgrade. Specifically, Delta will use the names of the top 100 rivers in the world in terms of length, and use them in order as the version name of each major upgrade. The adoption of this plan stems from the meaning of the word "Delta" in geographical terms, which happens to refer to the impact triangle plain area at the downstream estuary of a large river.
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        According to Wikipedia data, the current<q id="tⅹ" title="List of global river length
        Rankings ">River Length Ranking List<a ref="#fⅹ"><sup>x</sup></a></q>The top 100 are the Nile River, Amazon River, Yangtze River Tocantins River.
    </i>
</p>

<h4>4.3.3 Proposal Types</h4>
<p>
In the DAO model, the main method of improving the system's operating parameters and upgrades is through proposals. We divide the main types of proposals into annual proposals and daily proposals.
</p>
<p>
Annual proposal: represents a proposal that can only be modified and executed once a year. In order to give this process more ceremonial feeling, we decided to execute the annual proposal on Delta's holiday (March 3). Usually, the annual proposal involves the modification of system parameters that have a wide impact, such as the modification of transaction fees.
</p>
<p>
Daily proposal: The proposals provided outside the general annual proposal are daily proposals.
</p>
<h2>Finally:</h2>
<p>
Delta's design and creation are not groundless. Delta is the result of standing on the shoulders of countless currency reformers and advocates to learn from their wisdom and summarize their experience. Delta's inspiration mainly comes from related books, documents, and projects such as "Denationalization of Currency", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Internet Computer", and "Pi
White Paper". I would like to express my gratitude to authors such as "Friedrich Hayek", "Satoshi Nakamoto", "Vitalik Buterin", "Dominic Williams", "Nicholas Kokkalis and Mr. and Mrs. Fan Chengdao". At the same time, I would like to thank everyone who has taken action and made contributions in the field of blockchain and non-sovereign currency. Thank you all. </p>
